# mipshw
A repo where I'll be storing my MIPS class homework. Simple programs meant to illustrate the basics of assembly programming. 
I am starting this "project" with 0 prior MIPS knowledge and will be linking in the source material. (Romanian for now but a translation is in the works and sits high on the TODO list. Code will be commented in English. 
Brace for impact!

## goals 
* Learn the basics of the language and document my experience through the code.
* Provide a bunch of code examples for someone who's studying the language and might find them useful.
* Provide entertainment through upcoming catastrophic failure or newbie mistakes within the code. :)
